KI-Programmierung WiSe 22/23


# Project Titel

Final project submission for the Course Seminar "KI in der Logistik - Programmierung WiSe 22/23" from Sangida Akter Mouli.

# Project Description
The project's goal is to build a Python program where a user can guess a number between 1 to 100, and the program could give feedback to the user if the guessed number is too high, low or equal to the guessed number.

# Program Features

- To reach the goal of the project Random module is used to generate a random number between 1 and hundred 100.

- I have created a function named "rand" and used randint() method, which outputs a random number between two given numbers. The method randint() takes two parameters: the starting and ending numbers (inclusive).

- To check the conditions if Guessed number matched the random number while the loop is used. While loop can execute set of statements as long as a condition is true.

- I have used two variables "attempts" and "guess". The initial input from the user is stored in "guess" variable and the number of tries for guess are incremented in "attempts" variable

- I kept the sanity check option for empty inputs, if there is no input from the user the loop will stop the current iteration and would move to the next. [all the inputs would be taken as integer]

- Options included quitting the game anytime with a break statement when the user inputs 0. [ It is prompted to the user while taking input for the guess number.]

- Assigned a variable named ''attempts'' and kept incrementing by 1 for every action the user will take until the correct guess is reached. Finally printed the attempts variable to show how many tries were needed to guess the random number


# Setting up the environment
For this project i have downloaded and installed python 3.8.2 in my laptop. I used Visual studio code as IDE. A new repository is created in github for this project named "SangidaAkterMouli_3153852" as public including a README.md file. The python code for the project is commited in the repository.
